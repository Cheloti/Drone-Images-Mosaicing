# About

In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, have been finding applications in a range of fields. They are used to capture aerial imagery in sectors like precision agriculture, infrastructure, disaster management, city planning etc. The first crucial step after collecting aerial imagery is to generate a mosaic (or orthomosaic) from the imagery dataset or in a laymanâ€™s language a digital map. <br/>

This project contains the code written from scratch to generate mosaics out of drone imagery. This code can also be used for panorama generation.
